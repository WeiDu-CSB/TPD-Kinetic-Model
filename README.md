# TPD-Kinetic-Model
Matlab scripts for modeling targeted protein degradation. See model details in "Defining degradability landscape of protein degraders".  

- BRD: BRD system, reproduce Figure 2A/2B. Adapt this to simulate time course degradation response of your target of interest. 

- KINOME: KINOME system, generate results for Figure 3. Adapt this to fit degradation rate from single dose degradation level measurement of your target of interest. 

- LANDSCAPE: BTK system, reproduce Figure 4A/4B. Adapt this to simulate degradability landscape of your target of interest. 

- WEE1: WEE1 system, reproduce Figure 5A/5B/5E. Adapt this to simulate functional inhibition, inhibition landscape and hook effect of your target of interest.
